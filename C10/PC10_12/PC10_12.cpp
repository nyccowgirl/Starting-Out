 PASSWORD VERIFIER
 
 Imagine you are developing a software package that requires users to enter their own
 passwords. Your software requires that users' passwords meet the following criteria;
            - at least six characters long
            - contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase
            - at least one digit
