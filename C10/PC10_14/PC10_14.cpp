/*
 WORD SEPARATOR
 
 Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run
 together, but the first character of each word is uppercase. Covert the sentence to a
 string in which the words are  separated by spaces and only the first word starts with an
 uppercase letter. For example the string "StopAndSmellTheRoses." would bbe converted to
 "Stop and semll the roses."
