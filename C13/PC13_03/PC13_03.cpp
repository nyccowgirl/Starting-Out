/*
 CAR CLASS
 
 Write a class named Car with yearModel, make and speed. In addition, the class should have
 constructor and other member functions. Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a
 Car object, and then calls the accelerate function five times. After each call to the
 accelerate function, get the current speed of the car and display it. Then, call the brake
 function five times. After each call to the brake function, get the current speed of the
 car and display it.
