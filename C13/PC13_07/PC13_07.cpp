/*
 WIDGET FACTORY
 
 Design a class for a widget manufacturing plant. Assuming that 10 widgets may be produced
 each hour, the class object will calculate how many days it will take to produce any
 number of widgets. (The plant operates two shifts of eight hours each per day.) Write a
 program that asks the user for the number of widgets that have been ordered and then
 displays the number of days it will take to produce them.
