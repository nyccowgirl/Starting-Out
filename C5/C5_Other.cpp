/*
 
 5.6    initialization expression, test expression and update expression
 
 5.7    initialization expression: count = 0
        text expression: count < 50
        update expression: count++
 
        count = count = 0 ? count < 50 : count++;
 
 5.13   counter: x; accumulator: y
 
 5.14   sentinel value is used to terminate loop so care is needed to ensure it is not used
        otherwise (e.g., in a total/accumulator)
 
 5.15   incorporate negative value in test expression
 
 5.16   output file - write data; input file - read data
 
 5.17   open, process and close file
 
 5.18   text file - data encoded as text; binary file - data not encoded as text so can't
        use text editor
 
 5.19   sequential - access data from beginning to end; random - jump directly to data
        without reading everything in front of it
 
 5.20   ofstream - output file stream
 
 5.21   ifstream - input file stream
 
 5.24   outputFile.open(filename.c_str());
