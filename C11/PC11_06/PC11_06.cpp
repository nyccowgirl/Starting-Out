/*
 SOCCER SORES
 
 Write a program that stores data about a soccer player in a structure. The program should
 keep an array of 12 of these structures. When the program runs it should ask the user to
 enter the data for each player. It should then show a table that lists each player's
 number, name and points scored. The program should calculate and display the total points
 earned by the team. The number and name of the player who has earned the most points
 should be displayed.
